# FSF Signal Stratification Project

## Project Title

Feature Stability Framework (FSF): Signal Stratification in Heterogeneous Transcriptomic Data

## Project Purpose

The Feature Stability Framework (FSF) is a signal stratification framework designed to classify candidate biological signals according to their reproducible behavior under perturbation and heterogeneity.

FSF does not aim to replace differential expression analysis, feature selection, machine learning classification, or statistical inference methods. Instead, it operates as a downstream characterization layer that evaluates how candidate signals behave across repeated perturbations of a dataset.

The central premise of FSF is that biologically relevant signals may exhibit distinct stability patterns when datasets contain noise, subgroup structure, temporal variation, unequal sampling, or heterogeneous biological responses.

## Scientific Question

Given a set of candidate biological features, can reproducible signal behavior be identified and stratified into interpretable classes under repeated perturbation?

## Core Outputs

FSF assigns each feature to one of four signal strata:

* Stable Up
* Stable Down
* Stable Constant
* Unstable

These strata describe signal behavior rather than statistical significance.

## Input Requirements

FSF operates on:

* Candidate feature sets
* Expression matrices
* Sample metadata
* Defined perturbation schemes

Candidate features may originate from external methods such as:

* DESeq2
* limma
* edgeR
* Boruta
* MDFS
* LASSO
* Other feature prioritization methods

## Expected Benefits

FSF provides:

* Stability-oriented signal characterization
* Identification of reproducible signal classes
* Interpretation of heterogeneous responses
* Improved biological understanding of signal behavior under perturbation

## Scope

Initial validation will be performed using tardigrade stress-response transcriptomic datasets including:

* UV
* Desiccation
* Gamma radiation
* Heat stress
* Cold stress
* Osmotic stress

## Out of Scope

FSF is not intended to:

* Replace differential expression analysis
* Replace feature selection algorithms
* Replace machine learning classifiers
* Infer causal relationships
* Estimate biological mechanisms directly

FSF is intended solely as a signal stratification framework.
